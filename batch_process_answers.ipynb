    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This week we will use python to process a large set of data. GIS allows us to visually assess and interact with each step, whilst python allows us to easily scale up to processing large datasets with a single button press, making repeat processing easy. This follows on from the introduction to lidar session and is meant as an introduction to OOSA. We will use lidar data to map biomass along the Spey river valley.\n",

    "## Data\n",
    "\n",
    "We are using the DTM and DSM provided by the [Scottish government](https://remotesensingdata.gov.scot/data#/list). These were collected as point clouds and then processed to a DTM and DSM in geotiff format. After cloning these will be in the ***data*** directory. The raw data comes in 1 m resolution but the ALS point density was a little too low to support that, so we have coarsened it first to 3 m, taking the mean elevation for the DTM and the maximum elevation for the DSM, and then to 10 m taking the mean for both. Due to disk space limits on noteable, the data has already been coarsened for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "The 10 m resolution DTM and DSMs are available in the folders below, in geotiff raster format:\n",
    "\n",
    "    data/ALS/DTM\n",
    "    data/ALS/DSM\n",
    "\n",
    "Later on a python cell will be given to show you how that coarsening was done, and a single full-res DSM file has been provided in in case you want to run this process from first principles. Note that you can install Python on your own laptop, or use it on the University's Windows or Linux computers, where you will get access to move more disk space.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "You can download some of these tiles to your computer and view them in QGIS if you would like. Or you can use some of the plotting functions within python to view them here.\n",
    "\n",
    "This week we will use the rasterio package to open our data. Below you will see code which uses this module and its functions to open and read GeoTIFF files. Note that *there are many many many Python modules out there, some with overlapping functionality.* The [rasterio manual](https://rasterio.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) shows the many options available.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that our geotiff has some missing data, labelled as -999. We can filter out to allow you to calculate metrics on the data only using the *not a number* variable, *nan*.\n",
